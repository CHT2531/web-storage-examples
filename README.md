## Web Storage Examples

There are two examples:

* **Navigation**.This demonstrates how web storage can be used to pass data between different pages. 

* **Favourites**. This demonstrates how we can build a list of favourites items using web storage. 

Both examples are very simple e.g. data is hard-coded, they make use of global variables etc.
